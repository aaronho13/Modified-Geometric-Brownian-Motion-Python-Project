# Modified Geometric Brownian Motion Python Project

Summary: This project serves as a short expository on the findings of a Modified Geometric Brownian Motion formula, designed with better fittings and approximations for stock indices return distribution. 

# Motivation

This was a research project made for Derivatives Group Quantitative Trading RSO, specifically the Stochastic Calculus Cohort (Winter 2023), at The University of Chicago by Ryan Hathaway (ryanhathaway@uchicago.edu) and Aaron Ho (aaronho@uchicago.edu). This project serves as a visualization and slight analysis of the modified Geometric Brownian Motion formula in simulating return distributions as approximate normal or Gaussian distributions.
